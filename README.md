Budget Manager Application (WIP)

Overview
This is a work-in-progress web app for tracking income, expenses, and budget categories. The goal is a simple, fast interface for day-to-day money tracking with clear summaries.

What I am doing now
- Setting up the project structure and tooling
- Building the initial HTML/CSS layout
- Defining the core data model for budgets and transactions

What I intend to do next
- Add forms for income and expense entries
- Implement category budgets and totals
- Add local storage persistence
- Create summary views (monthly totals, category breakdowns)
- Improve UI polish and accessibility

Tech stack (current)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Parcel for local development

Notes
This README will expand as features land.
